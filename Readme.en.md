> "The universe operates not on arbitrary rules, but on cosmic laws. Φ-Chain is not just a blockchain—it's an expression of the Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) and Fibonacci sequence, where every block grows organically, and every state is reversible without loss."  
> – Badreddine Baha, Visionary Architect  

Φ-Chain is a revolutionary Layer-1 blockchain powered by **full temporal symmetry** (Reversible Core) and **Fibonacci Byzantine Agreement (FBA)**, designed to be entirely non-arbitrary. Imagine a chain that can "rewind" without forks, or selects validators based on natural Fibonacci laws—not randomness.  

## 🚀 Wallet and Mining Application Features

The front-end application provides the following functionalities:

*   **Secure Wallet Creation (New!):** Easily generate a new, non-custodial wallet with a unique 12-word mnemonic phrase and private key.
*   **Wallet Connection:** Connect seamlessly with existing wallets such as MetaMask, Phantom, and WalletConnect.
*   **Asset Management:** View your Φ token balance, staked sΦ tokens, and transaction history.
*   **PoC Mining Interface:** Interface for starting and monitoring the Proof-of-Coherence mining process.

## 🚨 The Problem & Solution: Why Φ-Chain?  
### The Problem:  
Consensus like Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake relies on random choices (VDFs or RANDAO), leading to:  
- **Imbalance**: High stake = unnatural dominance.  
- **Temporal Weakness**: Forks and lost states make records unreliable.  
- **Arbitrariness**: Transactions "designed" with random parameters, not cosmic laws.  

### The Solution:  
- **FBA (Fibonacci Byzantine Agreement)**: Selects proposers proportional to stake ∝ φ, ensuring organic growth and higher security (610 signatures for finality, F_15).  
- **Reversible Core**: Supports bidirectional Fibonacci (F(-n) = (-1)^{n+1} * F(n)) for complete time reversal, with quantum loop consensus for lossless recovery.  
This solves scalability and security issues, inspired by research like [Fibonacci Group Consensus Algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/17/3592), which reduces nodes in consensus via Fibonacci ratios.  

## 🧮 Mathematical Structure: Cosmic Laws in Code  
Every parameter in Φ-Chain derives from φ and F_n:  
- **Slot Duration**: F_6 = 8 seconds (the chain's "breathing rate").  
- **Q-Matrix**:  
  [ Q = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} ]GROK_BLOCK_LATEX_TEMP
Where S_{n+1} = Q · S_n, for exponential growth based on eigenvalues φ and 1-φ.  
- **Security**: Zeckendorf representation for over-collateralization, and tetrahedral pruning (6³ = 216) for state decay.  

Inspired by papers like [PHICOIN: Proof of Work High-Performance Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17979) using Phihash for fair mining, and [Lightweight Blockchain with Fibonacci](https://aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/mbe.2022556?viewType=HTML) for decision schemes in lightweight networks.  

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide  
1. **Clone the Repo**:

5. Build a Node: Read setup.py and run python setup.py install.
💡 Use Cases: Reversible Time in the Real World
•  Medical Records: Rewind states to recover “was the drug administered?” without forks—e.g., tamper-proof EHR blockchain.
•  Reverse Supply Chains: Track products from consumer to source (F(-n)) for instant counterfeit detection.
•  Reversible DeFi: Recover failed loans without liquidation, with ZK-proofs for privacy.
•  Gaming & NFTs: “Undo” mechanics in decentralized games, inspired by quantum superposition hashing.
