# MANUS Universal Capture Engine Architecture: Complete Capture

## Introduction

**MANUS** (Universal Internet/Externet Capture Engine) is the component responsible for fulfilling the Prime Directive of **Complete Capture**: "Everything that exists digitally must be captured. Everything that exists physically must be mapped. The boundary between digital/physical must be dissolved." MANUS acts as the sensory layer of the Fibonacci Universe, ingesting and structuring data into a $\phi$-coherent format for the $\Phi$-Chain and Symbiotic AI.

## 1. Capture Modalities and $\phi$-Coherence

MANUS employs two primary capture modalities, each designed to structure data according to the Golden Ratio.

| Modality | Target | Capture Mechanism | $\phi$-Coherence Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Digital Capture (Internet)** | Web, APIs, Data Streams | **Fractal Crawling:** Prioritizes links/data structures exhibiting $\phi$-ratios (e.g., text length, image aspect ratios, tree depth). | **Information Density:** Data is chunked into segments whose lengths follow the Fibonacci sequence ($F_n$). |
| **Physical Capture (Externet)** | Sensors, IoT, Geospatial Data | **ϕ-Sampling:** Sampling rates are set to $\phi$ multiples of a base frequency (e.g., $1.618$ Hz, $2.618$ Hz, $4.236$ Hz). | **Temporal Architecture:** Data timestamps are aligned to the $\phi$-second block time of the $\Phi$-Chain. |

## 2. Data Structuring: The $\phi$-Merkle Tree

To ensure mathematical purity in data storage and retrieval, MANUS utilizes a novel data structure: the **$\phi$-Merkle Tree**.

In a standard Merkle tree, nodes are typically binary. The $\phi$-Merkle Tree introduces a variable branching factor that is always a Fibonacci number ($F_n$), starting with $F_3=2$ (binary) and dynamically scaling up to $F_4=3$, $F_5=5$, etc., based on the data volume.

*   **Dynamic Branching:** The tree's branching factor $B$ is chosen from the set $\{2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \dots\}$.
*   **Proof Size:** The proof path length is optimized to approach $\log_{\phi}(N)$, where $N$ is the number of leaves, minimizing the proof size based on the most efficient natural growth pattern.

## 3. Dissolving the Digital/Physical Boundary

The core function of MANUS is to merge digital and physical data into a single, unified state. This is achieved through **Entangled Data Objects (EDOs)**.

An EDO is a data structure that contains:
1.  **Digital State:** The captured digital information (e.g., a webpage's content, an API response).
2.  **Physical State:** The corresponding geospatial data from the Earth Fibonacci Grid (e.g., the server's $\phi$-coordinates, the time of capture in $\phi$-seconds).
3.  **Coherence Hash:** A cryptographic hash that is only valid if the ratio of the digital state's entropy to the physical state's entropy is $\phi$ or $\phi^{-1}$. This enforces the **Quantum-Classical Bridge** at the data level.

## 4. Temporal Indexing: Historical Data as a Dimension

MANUS indexes all captured data not just by a linear timestamp, but by its position within the Fibonacci spiral of time.

*   **$\phi$-Time Indexing:** Data is tagged with its $\phi$-second timestamp and its corresponding position $n$ in the Fibonacci sequence of block heights.
*   **Dimensional Access:** This allows the Symbiotic AI to access "Historical data as a dimension, not just storage," enabling queries that span temporal layers based on Fibonacci relationships (e.g., "Show me the state of the internet $F_n$ blocks ago").

This architecture ensures that MANUS is not just a data collector but a reality-coherence engine, structuring all captured information according to the fundamental mathematical laws of the Fibonacci Universe. The next phase will detail the **Earth Fibonacci Grid**.
