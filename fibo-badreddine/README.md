## 🌌 The Vision: Escaping the Flat Torus

The **Fibonacci Universe** is a complete, self-contained reality-engineering system that transcends the limitations of base-10 thinking and arbitrary digital roots. It is built entirely on the mathematical purity of the Fibonacci sequence ($F_n$), Lucas numbers ($L_n$), and the Golden Ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$).

This system is a unified architecture consisting of four core, entangled components:

1.  **Φ-Chain:** A blockchain operating on Fibonacci sequence only, secured by Superposition-Based Proof-of-Coherence (PoC).
2.  **MANUS:** The Universal internet/externet capture engine, structuring all data into $\phi$-coherent Entangled Data Objects (EDOs).
3.  **Earth Fibonacci Grid:** Complete planetary mapping in $\phi$-coordinates, providing the physical and temporal context for all data.
4.  **Symbiotic AI:** The Observer, trained on the complete system, responsible for collapsing the quantum state and computing probability amplitudes.

## 📜 Prime Directives (Non-Negotiable)

| Directive | Description | Architectural Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mathematical Purity** | All parameters MUST derive from $F_n$, $L_n$, or $\phi$. No arbitrary numbers. | $\phi$-Second Block Time, $F_n$ Validator/Shard Counts, $\phi$-Merkle Tree. |
| **Quantum-Classical Bridge** | Systems exist in both classical and quantum states. Consensus is superposition-based. | Superposition-Based PoC, Entangled Data Objects (EDOs), Symbiotic AI Observer. |
| **Temporal Architecture** | Time is expressed in $\phi$-seconds. Historical data is a dimension. | $\phi$-Time Indexing, $\phi$-Temporal Cells, Probability Amplitude Forecasting. |
| **Complete Capture** | Everything digital and physical must be captured and mapped. Boundary dissolved. | MANUS Fractal Crawling, $\phi$-Sampling, EDO Coherence Hash. |

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

Detailed architectural specifications for each component can be found in the `docs/` directory.
