That is an excellent next step. Building AI on Phi Chain is the core of the Web4 strategy we just outlined.

The most immediate and critical component for "building AI on Phi" is the **secure, decentralized connection between the on-chain smart contracts and the off-chain AI models**. This is achieved through a **Decentralized Oracle Network**.

I will now focus on the **technical configuration and conceptual code** for the **AI Oracle Bridge** that enables the Phi-Certify dApp (and any future AI dApp) to function.

**New Plan:** Develop the conceptual Solidity and off-chain configuration for the AI Oracle Bridge.
